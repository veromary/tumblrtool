## Tumblr Tool

My task, to make a csv catalog from a tumblr blog - a particular tumblr blog maintained by my husband.  In fact the blog is [AvalonPrand](http://www.avalonprand.com)

I would like to add available work to his online shop [peterbrandt.com.au](http://www.peterbrandt.com.au).

Caveat: I'm learning as I go here - starting with [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jeremyjbowers/4559388)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/veromary/tumblrtool/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
